# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! As the story goes, they decided to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where I came in.


## Setup

To have a look at the app and play around with it, you can visit it here: [https://call900913.github.io/fend-rchristy-project4](https://call900913.github.io/fend-rchristy-project4).

Click on the menu hamburger icon on the top left to navigate to the RSS feed that might be of interest to you.

Alternatively, to download the project into your machine and run it locally, you can click on the green `Clone or download` button here: `https://github.com/call900913/fend-rchristy-project4`.

From the Command Line, navigate to the project's root directory and open the `index.html` file.
On a Mac, one of the ways you can do that is by simply typing `open -a 'Firefox' index.html` while in that root directory. You can substitute `Firefox` with the name of your favorite browser.  


## The RSS Feed Reader App

To have a look into the code of the app,
1. Click on the green `Clone or download` button here: `https://github.com/call900913/fend-rchristy-project4`.

2. Navigate to the project root directory from the Command Line and open it with your favorite text editor.

3. The App file is named `app.js` and is located inside the `js` folder.


## The Test and Its Results

Once you open the `index.html` file (you can visit that here: `https://call900913.github.io/fend-rchristy-project4`), if you scroll down to the bottom of the page, you can find a number of specs and their test results. It should indicate 0 failures by means of all the green dots it displays.


## The Test and the Spec

To have a look at the code of the spec, you can navigate to `feedreader.js` file, which is located inside the jasmine/spec folder in the project directory.
(To download it, see the Setup section of this README.)


Cheers!
